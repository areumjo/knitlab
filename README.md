Today's digital knitting tools often require designers to juggle between multiple platforms for charting, editing, and writing instructions. Knitlab was built to streamline that process, offering a seamless, all-in-one design experience for knitters.

Knitlab is our vision for a "Figma for knitting": a powerful, precision-focused, and user-friendly design platform that supports every step of the creative process.

## What is Knitlab?

Knitlab is an all-in-one design environment that unifies stitch charting, an extensible symbol library, and pattern generation. It's built for both prosumer knitters and professional designers who demand complete control over their creative process, from the first sketch to the final pattern.

## Features

* **A Professional Charting Canvas:** Knitlab's canvas goes beyond basic grids, supporting layers, hybrid color-and-symbol charting, and advanced tools like repeat definition, mirroring, and precision selections.

* **An Extensible Symbol Library:** Design your own custom symbols, from complex multi-cell cables to freeform line-based elements, and save them to your personal library using the powerful Key Editor.

* **Integrated Workflow, From Image to Text:** Seamlessly move from ideas to finished patterns. Convert images into colorwork charts and automatically generate row-by-row instructions directly from your visual designs.

* **Modern, Web-First Experience:** No installations, no outdated software. Knitlab runs entirely in your browser, offering a clean, responsive interface with both light and dark modes, allowing you to focus on your creativity.

## For Developers and Designers

Knitlab isn't just a tool for knitters — it's also a robust example of a modern, single-page application. Developers can explore its architecture and learn more from the developer documentation.

Knitlab brings precision, flexibility, and modern design to the world of digital knitting — making it the ideal platform for designers of all levels.
