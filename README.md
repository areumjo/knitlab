# Run and deploy your AI Studio app

This contains everything you need to run your app locally.

## Run Locally

**Prerequisites:** Node.js

1. Install dependencies:
   `npm install`
2. Run the app:
   `npm run dev`
3. Run the build command to generate the production files:
   `npm run build`
4. Preview the production build locally:
   `npm run preview`

This will start a local server (usually at http://localhost:4173) so you can see exactly what will be deployed.
